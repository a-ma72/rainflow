# README.md

This folder contains extracts of the core source codes for the Rainflow  
counting (`rainflow.c` and `rainflow.h`). The extracts were generated  
using the tool `unifdef.exe` ([https://dotat.at/prog/unifdef/]) from the  
original files.  
`unifdef.exe` reduces the code to its essential components without the additional  
features, highlighting the Rainflow counting algorithm within the source code.  
This makes the code easier to understand.
