From the coan website:
======================
Coan is a software engineering tool for analysing preprocessor-based
configurations of C or C++ source code. Its principal use is to simplify a
body of source code by eliminating any parts that are redundant with respect
to a specified configuration. Dead code removal is an application of this sort.

Coan is most useful to developers of constantly evolving products with large
code bases, where preprocessor definitions and #if-directives are used
differentiate progressive releases or parallel variants of the product.
In these settings the upkeep of the product's configuration tree can become
difficult and the incidence of configuration-related defects can become costly.
(The side-panels on these pages illustrate how preprocessor-encrusted
production code can get.) Coan can largely automate the maintenance of
preprocessor-based configurations and the investigation of
configuration-related questions.
